* ICFP paper
** TODO Create outline draft of the paper for ICFP
* Haskell refinement
** DONE Refine ByteStrings in terms of heaps (generically)
** DONE Implement a ByteString using our canonical heap and FMapList
** DONE Ensure that basic code runs in Haskell
** TODO Build an axiomatic model of the Haskell FFI memory allocator
** TODO Create QuickCheck tests for assumptions of the Haskell FFI model
** TODO Reflect the FFI axioms automatically as QuickCheck tests in Haskell
** TODO Refine an FFI-based heap
** TODO Implement a ByteString using the FFI heap
** TODO Ensure that basic code still runs in Haskell
** TODO Begin comparing selected functions for runtime equivalence
... with the current version of the bytestring library
** TODO Get "fold" working, in order to test Ben's FixComp logic
* ByteString library
** DELEGATED Add support for multi-arity ADT methods (needed for "append")
** TODO Determine if there is a way to formalize effects in a specification
** TODO Extend the original Heap spec to include error effects
For example, alerting the user that "peek" has no meaning if the address
specified does not map to an allocated, initialized value.
