## Welcome to the ByteString/Fiat project!

The goal of this project is to use the [Fiat](http://plv.csail.mit.edu/fiat/)
program synthesis library for [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) to build a simple,
mathematically correct specification for the Haskell ByteString library, and
then *refine* this specification to a highly-optimized Haskell program that
matches or exceeds what is available on
[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring) today.
